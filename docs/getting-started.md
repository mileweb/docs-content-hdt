# Quick Start

Using the ECP to deploy your containerized applications involves the following steps:

1. [Log in](</docs/portal/accessing-portal/logging-in.md>) to the portal.
2. Add and deploy an application by either [following a wizard](</docs/portal/applications/adding-and-deploying-applications.md#adding-and-deploying-applications-using-a-wizard>) or [uploading a YAML or JSON file](</docs/portal/applications/adding-and-deploying-applications.md#uploading-a-yaml-or-json-file>).

3. [Add a CNAME](</docs/portal/cnames/adding-a-cname.md>) to allow the ECP to manage global traffic for your application.

4. Change the DNS for your application and point your domain name to the CNAME created.
