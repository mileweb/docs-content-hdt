# Navigating the ECP User Interface

After you sign up for an ECP account, you will have access to the ECP documentation and online help.

When you first log in to the ECP portal, the Dashboard appears with menus and submenus in the left pane.

The default menu lists the ECP activities you can perform.

## Dashboard

The [Dashboard](</docs/portal/dashboard.md>) is the landing page after you log in to the ECP. It provides an overview of resource quota consumption and resource usage metrics.

## Reports

The [Reports page](</docs/portal/reports.md>) allows you to generate reports about bandwidth, traffic, CPU, memory, and storage resources as well as pods and public IP addresses.

## Applications

The [Applications page](</docs/portal/applications/managing-applications.md>) allows you to configure your containerized application once, and then deploy your application to CDNetworks' ECP locations across the globe with a single click.

## ImagePullSecrets

The [ImagePullSecrets page](</docs/portal/image-pull-secrets/managing-image-pull-secrets.md>) allows you to manage a Kubernetes secret of type “docker-registry” that an ECP cluster will use to authenticate with your container registry and pull a private image for your application.

## CNAMEs

The [CNAMEs page](</docs/portal/cnames/managing-cnames.md>) allows you to create and manage the Canonical Name Record (CNAME) that allows the ECP to manage traffic routing for the application.

## Global Presence Page

The [Global Presence page](</docs/portal/global-presence.md>) shows the worldwide locations of CDNetworks' PoPs. Controls allow you to filter PoPs by region, service zone, and status.

## User Info

Clicking the blue circle at the top of the page displays the user information. It also provides a **Logout** link for exiting the ECP portal.
