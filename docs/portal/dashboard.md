# Understanding the Dashboard

The Dashboard appears when you first log in to the CDNetworks portal.

Its charts provide a snapshot of your account's traffic. And clicking **View Full Report** in the upper right corner of the chart displays the chart on the [Reports page](</docs/portal/reports.md>), where you can define report parameters, and then view the results on the selected chart.

Hold your cursor over data points in the report to view detailed information. The default time zone in the tooltips is from the local browser time, you can also overwrite it by changing the timezone in "My Info".
