# Dashboard

HDT Dashboard give you information about the traffic of your HDT transports.

If you are a reseller with child accounts, you can select the accounts that the dashboards cover (the parent account only, the child account only, or both the parent and child accounts).

## Understanding the Dashboard

The Dashboard appears when you first log into the {{title}} portal. The charts provide a snapshot of your account's traffic, covering "Traffic Volume", "Traffic Bandwidth" and "Requests".

If you are a paid customer of **Virtual Private Line** usage, you can also switch between “Total” and “Virtual Private Line” dashboard by clicking the selection button at the upper right corner.

The default time zone in the tooltips is from the local browser time. You can also overwrite it by changing the time zone in "My Info".
