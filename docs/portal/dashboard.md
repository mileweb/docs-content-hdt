# Dashboard

The HDT Dashboard shows the traffic associated with your HDT transfers.

If you are a reseller with child accounts, you can select the accounts that the dashboards cover (the parent account only, the child account only, or both the parent and child accounts).

## Understanding the Dashboard

The Dashboard appears when you first log into the {{title}} portal. Charts provide a snapshot of your account traffic and cover "Traffic Volume", "Traffic Bandwidth" and "Requests".

If you are a paid customer of **Virtual Private Line** usage, you can also switch between the “Total” and “Virtual Private Line” dashboard by clicking the selection button at the top-right corner.

The default time zone shown in the tooltips is based on the local browser time. To change the time zone, use the "My Info" page.

Clicking **View Full Report** in the top-right corner of the chart displays a chart on the [Reports page](</docs/portal/reports.md>), where you can define report parameters, and then view the results on the selected chart.
