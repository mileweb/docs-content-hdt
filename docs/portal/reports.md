# Reports

HDT Reports give you information about traffic to your HDT transports, covering "Traffic Volume", "Traffic Bandwidth" and "Requests"

If you are a reseller with child accounts, you can select the accounts that a report will cover (the parent account only, the child account only, or both the parent and child accounts).
