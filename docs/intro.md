# Welcome to the Edge Computing Platform Customer Portal

The Edge Computing Platform (ECP) Customer Portal is a web-based user interface for the CDNetworks ECP platform. You can use the portal to deploy your containerized applications to ECP locations, troubleshoot your applications, and direct and manage global traffic towards the applications. You can also use the portal to retrieve detailed reports about the usage of compute, network, and storage resources provisioned by the ECP.

**Note**: The ECP is a multi-cluster container orchestration platform built on [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/>) and [Kubernetes](<https://kubernetes.io/>). If you are not familiar with these systems, it is strongly recommended that you read the official [Docker](<https://docs.docker.com/>) and [Kubernetes](<https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>) documentation before continuing with the ECP.

## ECP Features

- Support for native Kubernetes API

- Easy access to compute, network, and storage resources at the edge around the globe
- Availability of both APIs and management console for platform interactions and application manipulation
- Configure the application once, and then enjoy automatic delivery of applications to the edge around the globe
- Easy application life cycle management — from application configuration, deployment, update, and scaling to troubleshooting
- Intelligent global traffic management (i.e., GSLB CNAME)
- Generate reports covering bandwidth, traffic, CPU, memory, storage, and pods and public IP addresses
