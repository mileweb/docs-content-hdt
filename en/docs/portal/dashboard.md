# Dashboard
The Dashboard page is the default page that appears when you log in to the HDT portal. You can return to the page by clicking **Dashboard** in the left pane.

The Dashboard contains charts that show a snapshot of your account traffic over a recent period of time. If you are a paid customer for Virtual Private Line usage, you can also switch between the **Total** and **Virtual Private Line** dashboard by clicking the selection button at the top-right corner.

The default time zone in the tooltips is from the local browser time. You can overwrite it by changing the timezone in **User Info** settings.
