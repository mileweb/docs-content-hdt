# Dashboard
The Dashboard page is the default page that appears when you log in to the HDT portal. You can also come back to the page by clicking **Dashboard** in the left pane.

The Dashboard contains charts that show a snapshot of your account traffic over a recent period of time including "Traffic Volume", "Traffic Bandwidth" and "Requests" respectively.

If you are a paid customer for Virtual Private Line usage, you can also switch between the “Total” and “Virtual Private Line” dashboard by clicking the selection button at the top right corner.

The default time zone in the tooltips is from the local browser time. You can overwrite it by changing the timezone in user info settings.
