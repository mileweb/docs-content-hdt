### How to preserve client IP addresses on the HDT platform?
We've posted a blog about [How to preserve client IP addresses on the HDT platform](<https://www.cdnetworks.com/enterprise-applications-blog/how-to-preserve-client-ip-addresses-on-the-hdt-platform/>), it elaborated on the methods that HDT provides to send client information to the origin server.

It mentioned that you can contact the our  [HDT support team](mailto:support@cdnetworks.com)to enable preserving of client IP addresses. Now you can also enable it by yourself through HDT web portal.

For HTTP/HTTPs applications,  X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header is enabled by default.
For Other applications, you can enable it in the [Edit a transport](</docs/portal/transports/edit-transport.md>) page.
