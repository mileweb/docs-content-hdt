3. When prompted, change the settings of the copied transport to suit your requirements. You must specify a new port range.

**Note:** The new port range cannot exceed 200. Ports **2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2098, 2500, 4101, 14101, and 57891** are reserved by the HDT platform. You can specify these ports in your port range, but they will not take effect.
