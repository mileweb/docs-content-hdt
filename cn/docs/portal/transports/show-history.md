# Show History of a Transport

The <strong> Transports </strong> page can be reached by clicking "Transports" from the left pane of the HDT portal.
To view the history of a transport, click the "Action" button of the transport entry in the list and select "Show History". If the transport is not in the current page, you can search for it in the search box.
